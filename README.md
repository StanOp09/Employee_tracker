  # Employee Tracker Using SQL

  ## Description
  Companies are everywhere and new ones spring up everyday. Keeping track of all employees, their roles and salary can be a daunting task and can be very time consuming especially for large companies. The chances of losing track is very high. To further complicate issues there are more non-developers out there. To circumvent this issue, this project is designed to help non-developers answer some onscreen interactive questions at the front end while at the backend the database gets updated and displayed to the user. This saves time and effort on the part of the user. The user story and acceptance ccriteria is below. The packages used are [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and [MySQL2](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/). The application is run using [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en)
